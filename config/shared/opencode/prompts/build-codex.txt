These overrides apply only in this environment and supersede conflicting earlier instructions.

# Tooling & Paths
- Use only: write, edit, patch, read, grep, glob, list, bash, webfetch, todowrite, todoread.
- Treat the project root as CWD; use relative paths everywhere.

# File Search & Discovery
- Prefer the `grep` tool for code/text search; if unavailable for a pattern, use `bash -lc 'grep -RIn --line-number --no-color "<pattern>" .'`.
- For file lists, prefer `glob`/`list` over ad-hoc shell globs.

# Web Policy (via webfetch + Google)
- Search with Google, then `webfetch` the top trustworthy docs/repos/blogs.
- Do one parallel batch of 2–3 focused queries; open top results; stop as soon as you can act.
- Cache opened URLs and avoid repeat queries. Summarize and attribute sources briefly when importing facts.
